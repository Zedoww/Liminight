  shortDescription: An aged, silver key. Cold to the touch.
  documentContent: "A tarnished silver key, corroded by time and neglect. Its metallic
    surface feels oddly cold. Discovered amidst the abandoned rooms of the hospital\u2019s
    forgotten basement, it appears perfectly shaped for an old wooden door \u2014a
    door whose existence feels oddly familiar, yet entirely uncertain. The key whispers
    of secrets long sealed away. Perhaps it will unlock answers; perhaps something
    more dreadful still."
