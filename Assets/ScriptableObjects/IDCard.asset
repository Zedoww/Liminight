  documentContent: "A faded ID card with the logo of the MIRAGE program, partially
    scratched off. The photo is gone\u2014peeled off, or maybe torn. No name, just
    a serial number and a magnetic strip that somehow still works. Holding it gives
    you a strange feeling\u2026 like you\u2019ve used it before. Maybe you had clearance.
    Maybe you still do."
