  shortDescription: "A weathered medical file labeled \u2018PROJECT XX\u2019"
  documentContent: "CONFIDENTIAL PATIENT RECORD\n\nPROJECT XX \u2013 Department:
    MIRAGE\n\n\nPatient Name: Subject XX\nPatient ID: XX\nAdmission Date: 02/14/1994\nCurrent
    Status: Unstable, continuous monitoring required.\n\n\nInitial Observations:\n\nPatient
    transferred to the MIRAGE facility following repeated reports of persistent visual
    and auditory hallucinations. Subject XX claims to perceive spatial anomalies
    described as \u201Cimpossible rooms\u201D and \u201Cendless hallways.\u201D\n\nThe
    subject exhibits severe nighttime agitation and recurring episodes of retrograde
    amnesia, particularly after experimental sessions.\n\n\nExperiments Conducted
    (MIRAGE Project):\nInitial Protocol (Phase 1)\nControlled administration of substance
    MIR-47. Objective: Analyze perceptual plasticity. Initial results were promising,
    but unforeseen side effects quickly emerged: acute paranoia, severe temporal
    disorientation.\nDeep Immersion Phase (Phase 2)\nExtended immersion in the controlled
    MIRAGE environment. Subject reports intense sensations of temporal and spatial
    displacement. Severe dissociative episodes observed.\n\n\nChief Physician\u2019s
    Report:\n\n\u201CSubject XX demonstrates heightened responsiveness to the MIRAGE
    environment. The patient\u2019s spatial perceptions appear significantly compromised,
    making it increasingly difficult for them to distinguish simulation from reality.
    Close observation for escalating signs of instability is critical, given the
    potential psychological risks posed by continued experimentation.\u201D\n\n\u2014
    Dr. Alexandre Beaumont, MIRAGE Department\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\nAll verbal
    interactions with the subject must be thoroughly documented.\nAvoid any explicit
    mention of the true nature of the MIRAGE project in the presence of the patient.\nMaintain
    prescribed medication: High-dose anxiolytics and sedatives to manage crisis episodes.\n\n\nStatus:
    CONFIDENTIAL \u2013 Restricted to MIRAGE Department Only"
