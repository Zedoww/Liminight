  shortDescription: "[CONFIDENTIAL \u2013 Emergency Protocol Activation Notice]"
  documentContent: "PROJECT MIRAGE \u2014 Level -10\n\nAttention to all MIRAGE Department
    personnel:\n\nFollowing the critical failure of the elevator containment mechanism,
    Subject XX has inadvertently breached controlled containment within Level -10.
    Subject currently exhibits symptoms consistent with severe cognitive disorientation
    and partial memory loss induced by recursive exposure.\n\nImmediate containment
    measures are in place:\n\nRestoration of emergency electrical systems is mandatory
    to re-enable internal security protocols. Recovery of three essential fuse components
    is required for reactivation.\n\nSubject XX must not gain awareness of experimental
    manipulation; ensure strict adherence to the MIRAGE interaction guidelines.\n\nSecurity
    access and maintenance equipment (card keys, bolt cutters) must remain secured
    until necessary. Prevent premature subject access.\n\nAll staff must avoid direct
    subject contact unless explicitly authorized. Monitor closely via remote observation
    methods. Document any anomalies without interference.\n\nThis incident marks
    a critical phase in Subject XX\u2019s therapy\u2014his perceived autonomy during
    crisis resolution is fundamental to the success of the integration process.\n\nDocument
    Status: Highly Confidential \u2013 Authorized Personnel Only"
