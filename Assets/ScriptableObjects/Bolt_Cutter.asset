  shortDescription: Heavy tool. Rusty. Still sharp enough to break through something
  documentContent: "A large, rusted bolt cutter found in a forgotten maintenance
    room. The grips are worn and sticky, and there\u2019s dried grime near the blades.
    It was probably used to seal off areas after the experiments began\u2026 or to
    force entry back in. Can break through padlocks and chains. Might only survive
    a few uses."
